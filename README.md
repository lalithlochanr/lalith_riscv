  * Introduction to Logic Gates

 - Logic gates are fundamental building blocks of digital electronic circuits. They are simple devices or components that perform basic logical operations on binary data, which is composed of ones and zeros.

- Combinational Circuit
  - A combinational circuit is a type of digital electronic circuit that produces an output based solely on the current values of its input signals, without any regard for previous inputs or a feedback mechanism.

- Adder
  - An adder block in digital circuits is a specific combinational circuit designed to perform the arithmetic operation of addition and give the ouput of sum and carry on summing various input bits.

- Boolean Opertaors
 - Operators are used to perform logical operations on two or more Boolean values.

* Basic MUX implementation and Introduction to Makerchip
- MUX
   - A multiplexer is a digital electronic device or combinational circuit that selects one of several input data lines and forwards it to a single output line.

- Chaining ternary operator
  - A ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to express conditional statements in programming. Using multiple ternary operators making it a chaining ternary operator.
